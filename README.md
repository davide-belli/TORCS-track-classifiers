# TORCS-track-classifiers
### Implemented many SVM and XGBoost classifier in order to discriminate between dirt and road tracks in TORCS simulator.

In the overall project, we realize at autonomous agent able to drive a car on a racing track, receiving as input signals from physics sensors in the emulator.
This component enables the agent to understand if it is racing on a dirt or road track, adapting its behavior and driving techniques accordingly.
